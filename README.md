# TR_Button
Start a variant button for Idle Champions</br>
Made by Thatman.</br>
</br>
Code "stolen" from IdleCombos, with permission.</br>
Just a simple sketch. Feel free to use this as is, or to add it to your script.</br>
</br>
Usage:</br>
-In IC, go to world map (end your current adventure)
-Run Start_TR.ahk</br>
-Click yes</br>
-Click Start TR -button</br>
-In IC switch to bg party and back</br>
</br>
-Update button is not needed, Start TR button does the updating also</br>
-Setup button is the same as first-run-setup</br>
</br>
If you have to manually locate webRequestLog.txt, it's here by default:</br> C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\IdleChampions\IdleDragons_Data\StreamingAssets\downloaded_files</br>
</br>
If you want to manually input user&hash, press Support "?" -button on Idle Champions lower right corner. From the link opened, copy your user_id&hash values. Note: do not use steam_user_id and hash which are in the same link. Look at the end part of the link, those are the correct values.</br>
Something like this: user_id: 1234567 device_hash: a3cb213a21b23abc13a21cb32ca1b3a1</br>
</br>
Tested only on Steam, EGS users might be out of luck.</br>
