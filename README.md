# TR_Button
Start a variant button for Idle Champions

Code "stolen" from IdleCombos, with permission.
Made by Thatman.
Just a simple sketch. Feel free to use this as is, or to add it to your script.

Usage:
-Run Start_TR.ahk
-Click yes
-Click Start TR -button
-Update button 

If you have to manually locate webRequestLog.txt, it's here by default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\IdleChampions\IdleDragons_Data\StreamingAssets\downloaded_files

If you want to manually input user&hash, press Support "?" -button on Idle Champions lower right corner. From the link opened, copy your user_id&hash values. Not; do not use steam_user_id and hash. Look at the end part of the link, those are the correct values.
Something like this: user_id: 1234567 device_hash: a3cb213a21b23abc13a21cb32ca1b3a1

Tested only on Steam, EGS users might be out of luck.
